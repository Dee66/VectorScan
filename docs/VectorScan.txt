VectorScan — Source of Truth & Final Specification (v1.0.0)

Document Type: Canonical Product + Architecture Specification
Status: FINAL
Owner: ShieldCraft AI — GuardSuite
Scope: Full CLI contract, schema, remediation, data integrity, I/O guarantees, policy update rules, test strategy, enterprise behaviors

I. Overview

VectorScan is the standalone, MIT-licensed Terraform plan auditor that enables any infrastructure, RAG, MLOps, or DevSecOps team to validate their tfplan.json with zero setup, deterministic output, and offline reproducibility.

VectorScan is the entry point into the GuardSuite ecosystem.
Its purpose is to provide a high-signal, high-trust, developer-friendly scanning experience that naturally funnels users into VectorGuard.

Core Philosophy

Governance must be codified, not documented.

II. Free Policy Bundle

VectorScan ships with two high-value, universal policies:

P-SEC-001 — Encryption Mandate

Enforces encryption + KMS key for data services.

P-FIN-001 — Mandatory Tagging

Requires CostCenter, Project, and other org-specific cost attribution tags.

III. Developer Experience (DX) Enhancements

VectorScan is not a simple policy scanner. It is a:

remediation engine

diff engine

contextual plan inspector

preview funnel to VectorGuard

1. Remediation Engine

All violations generate a structured remediation block:

"remediation": {
  "summary": "Enable storage_encrypted for aws_db_instance.db_prod.",
  "hcl_examples": [
    "resource \"aws_db_instance\" \"db_prod\" {\n  storage_encrypted = true\n  kms_key_id = \"arn:aws:kms:...\"\n}"
  ],
  "docs": [
    "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html",
    "https://shieldcraft-ai.com/docs/policies/encryption"
  ],
  "hcl_completeness": 0.85
}

Clarification: hcl_completeness

Confidence in the remediation depends on whether all required fields exist within the plan:

1.0 → pure HCL fix with no external variables needed.

<1.0 → remediation requires info from variables/modules.

0.0 → insufficient data to produce a patch.

New: data_taint + taint_explanation

Added to resource_details:

"data_taint": "variable_source",
"taint_explanation": "KMS Key ID inherited from variable 'kms_key_id' in module 'data_lake/main'"


This tells the engineer where the fix belongs (module vs direct resource).

IV. Contextual CLI Modes
A. Diff Mode

vectorscan --diff tfplan.json

Shows only changed attributes.
Adds a `plan_diff` block to JSON output (summary counts + per-resource attribute deltas) and appends a deterministic “Plan Diff Summary” after the CLI banner. Compatible with `--json --explain` so narratives reference the same diff-scoped data.

B. Explain Mode

vectorscan --explain tfplan.json

Explains:

what the plan is doing

high-risk resources

policy rationale

recommended guard conditions

C. Resource-Level Drilldown

vectorscan --resource aws_db_instance.prod tfplan.json

Filters violations & metadata to a single resource.

D. Interactive TUI (Future)

vectorscan --tui tfplan.json

Terminal UI explorer (v1.1+).

V. Plan Metadata & Streaming I/O Strategy
1. Plan Metadata Contract

VectorScan extracts a stable metadata block:

"plan_metadata": {
  "resource_count": 148,
  "module_count": 4,
  "providers": ["aws"],
  "adds": 12,
  "changes": 35,
  "destroys": 2,
  "resources_by_type": {
    "aws_s3_bucket": 4,
    "aws_db_instance": 2
  },
  "exceeds_threshold": false,
  "file_size_mb": 28.3
}

2. Large-File Performance Requirements

Terraform plans for >10k resources can exceed 50MB and sometimes hundreds of MB.

Streaming I/O Contract

VectorScan MUST:

use iterative/streaming JSON parsing
(e.g., ijson or equivalent iterators)

never load the full plan into memory at once

process resource_changes[] chunk-by-chunk

support multi-GB plan files without failure

Performance SLO

<1k resources → ≤200ms

<10k resources → ≤2s

≤1.5GB memory usage for multi-GB plan
If limits exceeded:

"exceeds_threshold": true

VI. Strategic Funnel Features
1. VectorGuard Preview Mode

vectorscan --preview-vectorguard tfplan.json

"preview_generated": true,
"preview_policies": [
  {"id": "P-SEC-002", "summary": "IAM roles would fail due to excessive permissions"},
  {"id": "P-AUD-001", "summary": "CloudTrail encryption enforcement would fail"}
]

Preview Mode Contract

NEVER executes paid policy logic.

Uses the preview manifest bundled with VectorScan.

Includes "preview_generated": true.

Exit code 10.

Preview manifest is signed.

VII. Enterprise & CI/CD Controls
GitHub Action Mode

vectorscan --gha tfplan.json

Outputs:

JSON only

deterministic formatting

no color

stable keys

Offline Mode

VSCAN_OFFLINE=1 vectorscan tfplan.json

Guarantees:

no internet

no DNS

no telemetry

no remote downloads

Any network attempt → exit code 6 (CONFIG_ERROR).

Severity Control
vectorscan --severity medium
vectorscan --fail-on-critical

Security Grade (Expanded)

Letter grade + exact severity counts:

"security_grade": "B",
"violation_count_by_severity": {
  "CRITICAL": 1,
  "HIGH": 0,
  "MEDIUM": 3,
  "LOW": 7
}

VIII. Policy Packs & Update/Sync Contract
CLI Flags
vectorscan --policies free
vectorscan --policies finops
vectorscan --policy P-SEC-001

Policy Distribution & Sync Contract

Each release must include:

policy_pack_hash

policy_source_url

policy_version

New CLI Flag

vectorscan --policy-manifest

Prints:

{
  "policy_version": "1.0.0",
  "policy_pack_hash": "sha256-abc123…",
  "policy_source_url": "https://github.com/shieldcraft-ai/policies",
  "signed": true,
  "signature": "base64..."
}


This provides an enterprise-grade audit trail.

schema_version
policy_version
policy_pack_hash
policy_source_url

resource_details
data_taint

5	TERRAFORM_ERROR
6	CONFIG_ERROR (incl. offline violation)
10	PREVIEW_MODE_ONLY
XI. Determinism Guarantees

VectorScan MUST guarantee:

deterministic field output

deterministic array ordering

deterministic key ordering

deterministic severity scoring

no randomness

timestamps only in non-strict mode

Golden tests MUST enforce 1:1 snapshot stability.

XII. Security Guarantees
Manifest Requirements

manifest.json MUST include:

schema_version
policy_version
policy_pack_hash
policy_source_url
signature
released_by
release_time
sha256_checksums


SBOM must be included for every platform binary.
